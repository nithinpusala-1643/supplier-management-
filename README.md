Title: supplier management

📝 Abstract (Simple Paragraph)
This project is a simple Supplier Management System built in C. It allows users to add, view, search, and delete supplier records using a console-based interface. Supplier information such as ID, name, and contact details is stored in an array structure, making the program easy to understand and use. The project demonstrates basic concepts of C programming like structures, arrays, and functions, while providing a practical example of how data can be managed efficiently. It is designed as a small-scale application that can be extended further, such as adding file storage or more advanced features.
